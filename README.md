# GS Assignment

## Project Setup & Running Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (preferably the latest LTS version).
- Install dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`.

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository (if applicable)
git clone <repository-url>
cd gs-assignment

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5173/`.

### Building the Project

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build in the `dist/` folder.

### Running ESLint for Code Linting

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Previewing the Build

```sh
npm run preview
```

This command serves the built project locally for testing before deployment.

## Features & Highlights

### What Went Well

- **Adapting to New Libraries**: Even though I was fairly new to `ag-grid`, `recharts`, and `shadcn/ui`, I successfully integrated them into the project.
- **Keeping Up with Modern Libraries**: As a developer, staying updated with the latest tools is crucial. My ability to quickly understand and utilize these libraries demonstrates my adaptability and willingness to learn.
- **Efficient State Management**: Zustand was used for efficient state management, reducing unnecessary re-renders.

## Improvements with Additional Time

If given **4 more hours**, I would:

- **Create a Reusable Select Component**: This would standardize and reduce redundancy across the project.
- **Implement Dark Mode**: Enhancing the UI/UX for users who prefer dark mode.
- **Add Authentication**: Implementing authentication would make the project more robust and production-ready.
