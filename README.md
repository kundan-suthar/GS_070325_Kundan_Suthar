## Features Implemented Successfully

- **Usage of Ag-Grid, Recharts, and ShadCN**: Despite being new to these libraries, I successfully implemented them to fulfill all requirements. As a developer, staying up to date with new technologies is essential, and I took this opportunity to learn and integrate these libraries effectively.

## Potential Improvements if Given More Time

- **Reusable Select Component**: I would create a single select component that could be reused across different use cases, reducing redundancy in my code.
- **Dark Mode Implementation**: Adding dark mode support would enhance the user experience and accessibility.
- **Authentication**: Implementing authentication would improve security and user management.

## Feedback on the Challenge

This was a well-structured challenge that provided a great opportunity to explore and implement new technologies. I enjoyed working on it!
